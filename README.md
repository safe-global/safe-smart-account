Usage
-----
### Install requirements with npm:

```bash
npm i
```

### Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
```

Optionally, if you want to run the ERC-4337 compatibility test, it uses a live bundler and node, so it contains some pre-requisites:

1. Define the environment variables:

```
ERC4337_TEST_BUNDLER_URL=
ERC4337_TEST_NODE_URL=
ERC4337_TEST_SINGLETON_ADDRESS=
ERC4337_TEST_SAFE_FACTORY_ADDRESS=
MNEMONIC=
```

2. Pre-fund the executor account derived from the mnemonic with some Native Token to cover the deployment of an ERC4337 module and the pre-fund of the Safe for the test operation.

### Deployments

A collection of the different Safe contract deployments and their addresses can be found in the [Safe deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository.

To add support for a new network follow the steps of the ``Deploy`` section and create a PR in the [Safe deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repository. 

### Deploy

> :warning: **Make sure to use the correct commit when deploying the contracts.** Any change (even comments) within the contract files will result in different addresses. The tagged versions that are used by the Safe team can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/releases).

> **Current version:** The latest release is [v1.4.1-3](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/tree/v1.4.1-3) on the commit [21dc824](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/commit/21dc82410445637820f600c7399a804ad55841d5)

This will deploy the contracts deterministically and verify the contracts on etherscan using [Solidity 0.7.6](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.6) by default.

Preparation:
- Set `MNEMONIC` in `.env`
- Set `INFURA_KEY` in `.env`
- For zkSync, set `ZKSYNC_DEPLOYER_PK` in `.env`

```bash
npm run deploy-all <network>
```

This will perform the following steps

```bash
npm run build
npx hardhat --network <network> deploy
npx hardhat --network <network> sourcify
npx hardhat --network <network> etherscan-verify
npx hardhat --network <network> local-verify
```

#### Custom Networks

It is possible to use the `NODE_URL` env var to connect to any EVM based network via an RPC endpoint. This connection then can be used with the `custom` network.

E.g. to deploy the Safe contract suite on that network you would run `npm run deploy-all custom`. 

The resulting addresses should be on all networks the same.

Note: Address will vary if contract code is changed or a different Solidity version is used.

#### Replay protection ([EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155))

Some networks require replay protection, making it incompatible with the default deployment process as it relies on a presigned transaction without replay protection (see https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy). 

Safe Smart Account contracts use a different deterministic deployment proxy (https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory). To make sure that the latest version of this package is installed, run `npm i --save-dev @safe-global/safe-singleton-factory` before deployment. For more information, including deploying the factory to a new network, please refer to the factory repo.  

Note: This will result in different addresses compared to hardhat's default deterministic deployment process.

### Verify contract

This command will use the deployment artifacts to compile the contracts and compare them to the onchain code
```bash
npx hardhat --network <network> local-verify
```

This command will upload the contract source to Etherscan
```bash
npx hardhat --network <network> etherscan-verify
```
