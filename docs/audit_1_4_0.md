##### Notes

The final audit was performed on commit [eb93dbb0f62e2dc1b308ac4c110038062df0a8c9](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/eb93dbb0f62e2dc1b308ac4c110038062df0a8c9).

There has been one minor bugfix after the audit related to ERC-4337 opcode compatibility:

-   [Pull request](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/pull/572)
-   [Commit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/commit/f8bd2159b64392d5b594f4e056be258ade2fefab)

A change of similar scope has been successfully audited in the 1.4.0 release. Therefore, after notifying the auditors, we concluded no re-audit was necessary.
